This project was developed in a group with educational purpose in the Trybe course

The skills of working with Redux in React and asynchronous actions were developed

The app starts with a screen where the person playing puts their name and email.
The email will be used to search for the associated photo on the Gravatar website, if any.
After logging in, she is redirected to the game where she must choose one of the available answers for each of the questions. 
The answer must be marked before the timer reaches zero, otherwise the answer must be considered wrong.
Each hit gives the player points that must be counted in a scoreboard in the application's header.
After 5 questions answered, the person who plays is redirected to a score screen, where it is shown depending on the number of hits.
At the end of each game, the person playing can access the leaderboard with the scores.
